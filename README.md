# DataQuery
A simple example of using MySQL in C# with a form, requires proper connection info to a database for the example to work.

The program reads data from **multiple files** and *creates* tables in a database.  
The user can perform the **Select** and **Insert** SQL commands to interact with the data.

>**Note:** Requires a proper connection string, currently the string reads as follows  
>       **"Server=XXXXXX;Database=XXXXXX;Uid=XXXXXX;Pwd=XXXXXX;"**
